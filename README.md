MVC Project Submission
----------------------

FEATURES
--------
You can watch the demo called “demo.mp4” in the project folder, but here’s a summary of our features.

MEMBER:
-------
Any new registered user is assigned a “member” role.
The member’s navbar has links for: Home, Profile, Search Bar, Settings, and Logout.
The home page contains the user’s posts and his friends’ as well.
A text area at the top to write the posts and/or attach an image.
The profile page has the following:
The user’s photo (and a default gender specific one if he didn’t upload any) and a button for uploading a new one.
The user’s information and a button to edit his information.
The user’s friends list, where a list of the users friends is shown with their friendship status. So he receives any friend request there, and also any outgoing requests are in that list.
And the user’s posts with their likes and comments.
Each post in the homepage or the profile has its own list of likes and comments which you can view by pressing on them.
Each user can remove or edit his own comments and posts.
User’s search bar allows the users to search for any other user by name or email, after pressing the search button.
While searching for a user and entering his profile you can see his posts and info.
While viewing others’ profiles, you can see a button to either send a friend request, cancel your request, or accept or reject their request, depending on their friendship status.
In the settings page the user can change his email or password.

ADMIN:
-------
The admin’s navbar has links for: Home, Users, Roles, Settings, and Logout.
In the home page, there is a side left bar containing the user info, and a timeline with the user’s posts and his friends’.
In the users tab, the admin can either view the list of users, edit user’s information or create a new user.
While creating the user, the admin can also specify his role.
While viewing the users list, there is a search bar that updates the list while typing (no refresh).
In the users list, the admin can block/unblock users and edit their info.
Blocked users will receive an “Access Denied” page when trying to login.
In the roles tab, the admin can either view the list of roles or create a new role.
From this list the admin can delete a role.
